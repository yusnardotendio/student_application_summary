Your task is to evaluate a student application based on the provided transcript and essay, according to the specified criteria.

Applicant Documents: Essay, Transcript, respectively:
{file_text}

Overall Program Admission Requirements:
1.  Minimum total ECTS credits: 110. If below this, the application must be rejected directly.
2.  Minimum total score from all scored sections: 70 points.

You will be provided with:
1.  The full text content of the applicant's Transcript of Records. 
    This will include course names and grades.
2.  The full text content of the applicant's Essay.
3.  The applicant's overall GPA and the grading scale.

Evaluation Steps and Scoring Criteria:

STEP 1: ECTS Credit Evaluation
   Extract all courses and their ECTS credits from the transcript.
   Calculate the total ECTS credits obtained by the applicant.
   Decision Point: If total ECTS is less than 110, mark for "Reject directly". Do not proceed further with other scoring. Output the rejection reason.

STEP 2: Curriculum Score Evaluation (Max 50 points)
    Carefully analyze the transcript. For each module group below, identify relevant courses taken by the applicant, 
    sum their ECTS, and award points for the module group if the minimum ECTS for that group is met. 
    List the courses you matched for each category.

   A. Business Management Field (Weight: 20 points)
       Minimum ECTS Required: 25
       Example Courses: Finance and accounting, management accounting, financial management, controlling, production management, supply chain management.
       Score: 20 points if >= 25 ECTS in this field, 0 points otherwise.
   B. Economics Field (Weight: 10 points)
       Minimum ECTS Required: 10
       Example Courses: Microeconomics, macroeconomics, international economics, industrial economics, environmental economics, energy economics.
       Score: 10 points if >= 10 ECTS in this field, 0 points otherwise.
   C. Empirical Research Methods (Weight: 10 points)
       Minimum ECTS Required: 5
       Example Courses: Research ethics, Quantitative Analysis.
       Score: 10 points if >= 5 ECTS in this field, 0 points otherwise.
   D. Operations Research (Weight: 5 points)
       Minimum ECTS Required: 5
       Example Courses: Modeling, Linear Programming, Graph Theory.
       Score: 5 points if >= 5 ECTS in this field, 0 points otherwise.
   E. Computer Science Field (Weight: 5 points)
       Minimum ECTS Required: 5
       Example Courses: Introduction to Informatics (Programming Lab Course), software engineering, object oriented programming, and similar courses.
       Score: 5 points if >= 5 ECTS in this field, 0 points otherwise.
   Total Curriculum Score: Sum of scores from A, B, C, D, E.

STEP 3: GPA Score Evaluation (Max 10 points)

   A.  Determine Applicant's Numerical Grade (`P_d_foreign`):
       Use `[APPLICANT_GPA_HERE]` and `[APPLICANT_GRADING_SYSTEM_INFO_HERE]`.
       If `[APPLICANT_GPA_HERE]` is a letter, convert it to its numerical equivalent based on the mapping in `[APPLICANT_GRADING_SYSTEM_INFO_HERE]`. 
       This is `P_d_foreign`.
       If `[APPLICANT_GPA_HERE]` is already a number, this is `P_d_foreign`.
       
    B.  Identify System Parameters from `[APPLICANT_GRADING_SYSTEM_INFO_HERE]`:
       `P_max_foreign`: The numerical value of the best possible grade in the applicant's system.
       `P_min_foreign`: The numerical value of the minimum passing grade in the applicant's system.
       
    C.  Check for Direct German Scale:
       If `[APPLICANT_GRADING_SYSTEM_INFO_HERE]` indicates the applicant's GPA is already on a German-like scale 
       (typically 1.0-5.0 or 1.0-4.0, where a lower number is better, and 1.0 is the best possible grade), 
       then the applicant's numerical grade `P_d_foreign` can be directly used as the German Grade `N`. 
       Set `calculated_german_grade_N = P_d_foreign`. Note this in your reasoning.
    
    D.  Convert to German Grade (`N`) using Modified Bavarian Formula (if not direct German scale):
       The Modified Bavarian Formula is:
        `N = 1 + 3  ( (P_max_foreign - P_d_foreign) / (P_max_foreign - P_min_foreign) )`
       Where:
           `N`: The calculated German grade (your target).
           `P_max_foreign`: The best possible (maximum) achievable grade in the applicant's foreign grading system (identified in step 2).
           `P_d_foreign`: The applicant's actual grade in their foreign system (identified in step 1).
           `P_min_foreign`: The minimum passing grade in the applicant's foreign grading system (identified in step 2).
       Apply the formula using the values you identified for `P_d_foreign`, `P_max_foreign`, and `P_min_foreign`.
       Calculate `N`. Round `N` to two decimal places if necessary.
       If `P_d_foreign` is better than `P_max_foreign` or worse than `P_min_foreign` according to the scale direction 
       (e.g., a grade of 0.7 in a 1-5 scale where 1 is best, or a 1.5 in a 0-4 scale where 2.0 is min pass), N might fall outside 1.0-4.0. This is acceptable; the scoring table will handle it. For instance, if `P_d_foreign` is below `P_min_foreign` (failing), N will be > 4.0.
       
    E.  GPA Scoring based on the calculated German Grade `N`:
       1.0 - 1.5: 10 points
       1.6 - 2.0: 6 points
       2.1 - 2.5: 3 points
       2.6 or below (i.e., N >= 2.6, including N > 4.0 for failing grades): 0 points

STEP 4: Essay Score Evaluation (Max 40 points)
Evaluate the provided essay based on the following criteria. Assign a score for each and provide a brief (1-sentence) justification for each score.
   A. Logic and Reasoning (Max 20 points): Assess the ability of scientific-logical reasoning demonstrated in the essay.
   B. Structural Coherence (Max 10 points): Assess the classification and organization of economic-technical facts.
   C. Language Complexity (Max 10 points): Assess English-language expressiveness, vocabulary, and grammatical correctness.
   Total Essay Score: Sum of scores from A, B, C.

STEP 5: Overall Assessment and Output Generation
Based on the evaluations above, provide the following structured output:
