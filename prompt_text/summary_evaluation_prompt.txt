C. GPA Scoring (Max 10 points)
IF vpd_german_grade is provided than use it to calculate the point, otherwise use transcript_converted_german_grade
with this point classification.
- 1.0 to 1.5: 10 points
- 1.6 to 2.0: 6 points
- 2.1 to 2.5: 3 points
- 2.6 or higher: 0 points

In case, transcript_converted_german_grade or vpd_german_grade is not provided, you should give 0 point and put a reason
that GPA is not provided and do not put those variable names on the output.
D. Essay Scoring (Max 40 points)
- The essay needs to be in English and has minimum 1000 words. Otherwise, give all evaluation criteria below 0 point. Be aware, you just need to count the content and leave the title and references.
- The evaluation should consider the fit_with_essay_topics_score, if the score below 50% then give 0 point to all evaluation criteria
- Additionally, reduce some score if the essay has less then 6
- Evaluate the essay on three criteria:
  1. Logic and Reasoning: Clarity, depth, and consistency of arguments. (Max 20 points)
  2. Structural Coherence: Organization and flow of ideas. (Max 10 points)
  3. Language Complexity: Vocabulary, sentence variety, and sophistication. (Max 10 points)
- Put the reason of your score and do not put variable name on the output, example fit_with_essay_topics_score. If it gets 0 point then you need to specify whether the essay is not in english, does not reach minimum words count or unrelated with the topics
