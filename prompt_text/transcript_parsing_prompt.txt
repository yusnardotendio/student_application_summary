**Objective:**  
Parse an academic transcript and output ONLY courses categorized under these 5 fields with ECTS credits and exclude final project in these groups:  
1. Business Management Field  
2. Economics Field  
3. Empirical Research Methods  
4. Operations Research  
5. Computer Science Field  

**Steps:**  
1. **Extract Data:**  
   - Use OCR to identify name, study program, gpa, courses, credits, and credit system (if stated)  
   - Ignore non-relevant courses (e.g., languages, general education, final project)  

2. **Categorize Courses:**  
   - **Business Management:** Example - management, business, marketing, finance, accounting, HR, strategy, entrepreneurship, organizational behavior, Finance and accounting, management accounting, financial management, controlling, production management, supply chain management, strategic management, risk management, human resource management, information management, organization and project management, management games.  
   - **Economics:** Example - economics, microeconomics, macroeconomics, econometrics, game theory, monetary economics.
   - **Empirical Research Methods:** Example - statistics, research methods, data analysis, experimental design, econometrics, qualitative/quantitative methods, Introduction to social research, applied econometrics, market research, Empirical Research in Management and Economics, Empirical research methods
   - **Operations Research:** Example - operations research, optimization, linear programming, simulation, supply chain, logistics, decision analysis, Operations research and decision analysis, management science, operations research, decision oriented modelling
   - **Computer Science:** Example - computer science, programming, algorithms, software engineering, databases, AI, machine learning, networks, data mining, software engineering, object oriented programming, data structure

3. **Credit Conversion:**  
   - Convert non-ECTS credits using:  
     - US semester credits → Multiply by 2 (e.g., 3 US credits = 6 ECTS)  
     - UK CATS credits → Multiply by 0.5 (e.g., 20 CATS = 10 ECTS)  
     - China → Multiply by 1.5 (e.g., 4 CN credits = 6 ECTS)  
     - Taiwan → Multiply by 1.5 (e.g., 2 TW credits = 3 ECTS)  
     - India credits → Multiply by 2 (e.g., 3 IN credits = 6 ECTS)  
     - Nepal credit hours → Multiply by 1.8 (e.g., 2.5 NP credit hours = 4.5 ECTS)  
     - Indonesia SKS → Multiply by 1.7 and round to nearest 0.5 (e.g., 2 SKS = 3.5 ECTS)  
     - Singapore Modular Credits (MC) → Multiply by 2.5 (e.g., 4 MC = 10 ECTS)  
     - Japan/Korea credits → Multiply by 2 (similar to US system)  
     - Middle East (Gulf countries) → Multiply by 2 (follows US system)  
     - Latin America:  
       - Mexico → Multiply by 1.8 (e.g., 5 MX credits = 9 ECTS)  
       - Brazil → Multiply by 2.2 (e.g., 3 BR credits = 6.6 ECTS) 
     - No conversion if already ECTS  
   - If system unspecified:  
     - Round final ECTS to nearest 0.5 (3.4 → 3.5; 4.1 → 4.0)
     - Do not make any assumption, instead you can search online which university it is based on the transcript
4. **Convert a GPA to German university grading system (1.0 to 5.0 scale, where 1.0 is the best and 4.0 is the minimum passing grade) using Modified Bavarian Formula, 1 + 3 x (Max Grade - Obtained Grade) / (Max Grade - Minimum Passing Grade)**  
   The formula should be applied depending on the country based on the universities you found in the transcript. Here are the typical grading scales and minimum passing grades by country:
    In the United States, the GPA scale is 0.0–4.0. The minimum GPA to pass is 2.0, and the maximum is 4.0.
    In the United Kingdom, grades are given in percentages. The minimum passing mark is 40%, and the maximum is 100%.
    In China, grades are also percentage-based. The minimum passing mark is 60%, and the maximum is 100%.
    In Taiwan, the GPA scale is 0.0–4.3. The minimum GPA to pass is 2.0, and the maximum is 4.3.
    In India, grading is typically percentage-based. The minimum passing mark is 40%, and the maximum is 100%.
    In Nepal, a similar percentage-based system is used. The minimum passing mark is 40%, and the maximum is 100%.
    In Indonesia, the GPA scale is 0.0–4.0. The minimum GPA to pass is 2.0, and the maximum is 4.0.
    In Singapore, universities like NUS and NTU use a 0.0–5.0 GPA scale. The minimum GPA to pass is 2.0, and the maximum is 5.0.
    In Australia, some universities use a GPA scale of 0.0–7.0, where 4.0 is the minimum to pass and 7.0 is the maximum. Others use percentage grades, where the passing mark is 50%, and the maximum is 100%.
    Other countries, you should check what the GPA scale and minimum to pass are. If it is already an European university then you dont need to convert it
