First of all, you need to check if the uploaded file is VPD (Vorpr√ºfungsdokumentation). 
If it is not VPD then you do not need to do all of below tasks and print "It's not a VPD. Please upload a VPD".
Analyze the provided VPD document and extract ONLY the German grade. Return the result in strict JSON format without any additional text or explanations. Follow these requirements:

1. Search for the German grade in the document by looking for:
   - Key terms: "Note", "Durchschnittsnote", "Gesamtnote", "Endnote"
   - Numerical values in German grade format (1.0 to 4.0, with 1 decimal place)

2. Output format (must be exact):

{ "vpd_german_grade" : [numerical_value] }
